			<h4>The Design &amp; Build Concept</h4>
			<p>REEF’s concept of Design/Build is based on the premise of a partnership formed between customer and builder right from the beginning of the home building process. Continuity and consistency are a given when the builder is involved in all aspects of custom home building including design, engineering, site planning and materials specifications, and ultimately the construction of the customer’s home.
			</p>
			<p>Bringing in the experts right from the beginning of the home building process eliminates or greatly reduces the chances for unnecessary surprises later in the process and creates a sense of team between builder and customer as they work together for a common goal.
			</p>
			<p>Design/Build breeds a certain synergy and trust unattainable in other more traditional and adversarial methods of doing business. We believe design/build makes the most sense and most importantly translates to peace of mind for our customers.
			</p>

			    <div id="building-benefits" class="content" data-slug="panel1">
			    	<p><span>Streamlined Process</span><br/>
			    	A Design/Build team manages the entire process from design planning and permitting through scheduling and final home delivery. This enables all phases of a project to be delivered on time and on budget on a consistent basis.
			    	</p>
			
						<p><span>Accountability</span><br/>
						Since REEF takes responsibility for the design this makes us fully accountable for any design errors or omissions and provides us with greater incentive to exercise the best quality control throughout the process.
						</p>
			
						<p><span>Quality Control</span><br/>
						As a Design/Build builder we are on-site from design through to delivery and beyond to insure quality control and compliance with plans and building specifications, codes and regulations, and quality workmanship in construction.			</p>
			
						<p><span>Time Savings &amp; Flexibility</span><br/>
						The Design/Build approach is a fluent, streamlined process which avoids recurring bottle-necks and unnecessary disruptions and delays that can typically hold up the traditional approach to custom building. Changes can be made during planning and construction without having to stop to confer with another “outside” professional (e.g. architect) before moving ahead in the process.
						</p>
			
						<p><span>Cost Savings</span><br/>
						As a full service Design/Build company we are able to provide design, engineering, and construction services at lower costs than what it would cost to hire an individual Architect, Engineer, Environmental Consultant, Structural Engineer, and others. We have a team of dedicated professionals working for the common goal of designing, obtaining permits, and building quality homes for our customers.

								During our initial consultation, we leave no stone unturned in order to earn the privilege to work with you. We will discuss your needs in greater detail to determine a budget, discuss preliminary specifications, and schedule future appointments.
								</p>
								<p>We work tirelessly to truly understand your needs and to make sure there are no conflicts between budget and your expectations prior to your commitment to us.

								<p>This agreement does not obligate you to build anything, but simply outlines the preliminary services you have engaged REEF to conduct, and represents a commitment to each other to work in good faith to build your new home, remodel, and/or addition.
								</p>

								<p>At the time of the Deposit Agreement we also commit to a starting month, and hold an opening in our schedule for you.

									Once we have all of your necessary permits and we have agreed on your final pricing, we enter into a more formal agreement to actively build your home. This agreement includes fixed pricing.

								<p>The only way your pricing will change is if you make a change during construction, which can either add on to or deduct from the cost. We provide a fixed amount of time to complete your project, with a penalty clause to protect you if we are late in delivering.
