			<h4>The Design &amp; Build Concept</h4>
			<p>REEF’s concept of Design/Build is based on the premise of a partnership formed between customer and builder right from the beginning of the home building process. Continuity and consistency are a given when the builder is involved in all aspects of custom home building including design, engineering, site planning and materials specifications, and ultimately the construction of the customer’s home.
			</p>
			<p>Bringing in the experts right from the beginning of the home building process eliminates or greatly reduces the chances for unnecessary surprises later in the process and creates a sense of team between builder and customer as they work together for a common goal.
			</p>
			<p>Design/Build breeds a certain synergy and trust unattainable in other more traditional and adversarial methods of doing business. We believe design/build makes the most sense and most importantly translates to peace of mind for our customers.

			    	<p><span>Streamlined Process</span><br/>
			    	A Design/Build team manages the entire process from design planning and permitting through scheduling and final home delivery. This enables all phases of a project to be delivered on time and on budget on a consistent basis.
			    	</p>
			
						<p><span>Accountability</span><br/>
						Since REEF takes responsibility for the design this makes us fully accountable for any design errors or omissions and provides us with greater incentive to exercise the best quality control throughout the process.
						</p>
			
						<p><span>Quality Control</span><br/>
						As a Design/Build builder we are on-site from design through to delivery and beyond to insure quality control and compliance with plans and building specifications, codes and regulations, and quality workmanship in construction.			</p>
			
						<p><span>Time Savings &amp; Flexibility</span><br/>
						The Design/Build approach is a fluent, streamlined process which avoids recurring bottle-necks and unnecessary disruptions and delays that can typically hold up the traditional approach to custom building. Changes can be made during planning and construction without having to stop to confer with another “outside” professional (e.g. architect) before moving ahead in the process.
						</p>
			
						<p><span>Cost Savings</span><br/>
						As a full service Design/Build company we are able to provide design, engineering, and construction services at lower costs than what it would cost to hire an individual Architect, Engineer, Environmental Consultant, Structural Engineer, and others. We have a team of dedicated professionals working for the common goal of designing, obtaining permits, and building quality homes for our customers.
